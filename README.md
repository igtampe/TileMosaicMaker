TileMosaicMaker (TMM) is a small, single form program that creates a tiled mosaic of images, based on a given set of tiles of the same size, of given width and height. It was made out of necesity for an unrelated small project.

Above is an example using textures from a lightly altered version of the Pamplemousse resource pack for the game Minecraft(TM). All rights to their respective authors.
